Main thing is the new CLI (see below what you can do with it). With that a few other changes were implemented.

### Added
* CLI
  * Analyze single files or whole directories and print information about it
  * Convert between JSON and actual save formats
  * Perform file operations
* `PlatformCollectionSettings` to configure `PlatformCollection`
* Support for game version **Orbital 4.60**

### Changed
* `PlatformSettings.MaxBackupCount <= 0` is now unlimited and not unintentionally disabling the backup feature
* `Container.ThrowHelperIsLoaded` now shows incompatibility if any
* Replace preferred platform in constructors of `PlatformCollection` with new `PlatformCollectionSettings`
* Moved `Settings` to its own namespace
