Major refactoring across the board with some breaking changes. Now also targeting
.NET 7 and publishing to the NuGet Gallery.

### Added
* Now targeting .NET 7 as per the [.NET release lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
* Now publishing to [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/libNOM.io)
* A setting to choose between writing always or only if a container is unsynced
* A privacy setting to decide whether external sources should be used to to improve
  user identification (e.g. launcher configs or API calls)
* An IPlatform interface you can use instead of the abstract base class
* Lots of UnitTests
* Support for game version **Echoes 4.40**
* Voyagers Expedition
* Support for macOS when Steam is used
* Probably more...

### Changed
* Bump K4os.Compression.LZ4 from 1.3.5 to 1.3.6
* Bump libNOM.map from 0.9.1 to 0.9.2
* Renamed the settings _LastWriteTime_ and _Mapping_
* Default value for some settings
* Names of the IsVersion flags now include the version number as well
* DifficultyPresetTypeEnum has been added and therefore PresetGameModeEnum is now
  only used internal
* More getter and setter for JSON tokens and values
* Probably more...

### Removed
* Maybe some things...

### Fixed
* The _Mapping_ settings is now only used to determine input/output and not for
  modifying things internally
* A number of different issues reported on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nomnom-762409407488720918) and the [NomNom repository](https://github.com/zencq/NomNom/milestone/10)
