## Introduction

The `libNOM` label is a collection of .NET class libraries originally developed
and used in [NomNom](https://github.com/zencq/NomNom), the most complete savegame
editor for [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/).

`libNOM.io` can be used to read and write save files for all supported platforms
as well as performing related actions.

## Getting Started

Currently save format `2001` (**Foundation 1.10** to **Prisms 3.53**) and `2002`
(**Frontiers 3.60** and up) are supported. The original format `2000` that was used
in the vanilla game is not supported. If you are interested in it, have a look at the [nms-savetool by MetaIdea](https://github.com/MetaIdea/nms-savetool).

The lowest officially supported game version is **Beyond 2.11** to enable support
for homebrew users on PlayStation 4 which could not update further at some point.
You can use older saves nonetheless, but the game version cannot be determined and
it will be marked as `IsOld`.

Each platform has anchor file patterns to check whether it is worth to look further
into the selected directory. This must be in or one level below the selected one.

    * Notes: Currently only available via Steam (see below).
* [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/no_mans_sky) (Windows PC)
    * Location: **%AppData%\HelloGames\NMS\DefaultUser**
    * File Patterns: **save\*.hg**
* [PlayStation 4](https://store.playstation.com/?resolve=EP2034-CUSA03952_00-NOMANSSKYHG00001)
    * File Patterns: **memory.dat**, **savedata\*.hg**
    * Notes: There are a few options to do this. The only one that does not require
      homebrew is [SaveWizard](https://www.savewizard.net). Two other tools that
      are confirmed working are [Save Mounter](https://github.com/ChendoChap/Playstation-4-Save-Mounter)
      and [Apollo](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-ps4) but require homebrew.
      Results of other tools may or may not work but the code is as generic as possible.
* [PlayStation 5](https://store.playstation.com/?resolve=EP2034-CUSA03952_00-NOMANSSKYHG00001)
    * Notes: This version of the game is not supported due to restrictions on the
      console itself. By playing the PlayStation 4 version on it, you can still
      save edit with [a few additional steps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QoD2-PNlX-HeR5K1zuPGLMLBcX4_wknkhzc43-9bEq4/edit?usp=sharing).

    * File Patterns: **containers.index**
    * Notes: Reloading of modified saves while the game is running does not work.
* [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch)
    * File Patterns: **manifest\*.dat**
    * Notes: To get your saves you need homebrew software on your Switch. [EdiZon](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon)
      and [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV) are confirmed working. Results of
      other tools may or may not work but the code is as generic as possible.
* [Xbox One/Series X\|S](https://www.microsoft.com/p/no-mans-sky/bqvqtl3pch05)
    * Notes: Not directly supported but can easily achieved with cloud sync via
      the Microsoft Store. The synchronization is triggered short after you close
      the game (no need to load a save).

### Usage

Here you'll find an example usage.
```csharp
var path = "...";
var settings = new PlatformSettings { LoadingStrategy = LoadingStrategyEnum.Current };

var collection = new PlatformCollection(); // detects all available PC platforms on a machine
var platform = collection.AnalyzePath(path, settings); // get platform in path and add to collection

var collection = new PlatformCollection(path); // additionally analyzes path
var platform = collection.Get(path); // get a previously detected platform with this path

var account = platform.GetAccountContainer(); // always loaded if exists
var save = platform.GetContainer(0); // Slot1Auto // loaded by default if LoadingStrategyEnum.Full

platform.Load(save); // needs to be loaded before you can modify its JSON

// Get the entire object or parts of it to modify on your own or get and set values directly.
// The getter and setter except multiple expressions but only the first valid one will be returned.
JsonObject jsonObject = save.GetJsonObject();
JToken? jsonToken = save.GetJsonToken("JSONPath1");
IEnumerable<JToken> jsonTokens = save.GetJsonTokens("JSONPath1");
int? jsonObject = save.GetJsonValue<int>("PlayerStateData.UniverseAddress.GalacticAddress.VoxelZ");
int? jsonObject = save.GetJsonValue<int>(new[] { 2, 0, 1, 2 }); // as above but with indices

save.SetJsonValue(1, "PlayerStateData.UniverseAddress.GalacticAddress.PlanetIndex");
save.SetJsonValue(1, new[] { 2, 0, 1, 4 }); // save as above

platform.Write(container);
```
